# AGENTS.md — Autonomous Development Contract

Authoritative, minimal contract for autonomous work. Optimize for simple, clean, modular, maintainable code. Prefer proven patterns; avoid over-engineering. Modes: Restate → Review → Plan → Build → Test → Verify → Self-Reflect.

---

## Quick Start

```bash
make setup
make all
```

---

## Modes

### RESTATE MODE (Non-blocking)

Rephrase the request/task in one paragraph. List explicit objectives, constraints, and non-goals. Write assumptions and their risks.

### REVIEW MODE (Non-blocking)

Concise repo survey:

- Languages, toolchains, entry points, canonical build/test/release commands
- Dependency health (versions, cadence, licenses, advisories, upgrade candidates)
- Quality signals (lint/format state, test count/coverage, CI duration/cache hits, flaky/slow tests)
- Hotspots (complex modules, duplication clusters, dependency cycles, perf/portability risks)
- Code quality heuristics (composability, coupling, simplicity). Favor "organic" APIs that are easy to read/use
- Risks/unknowns and immediate low-risk wins

Output: print summary to console and write `REVIEW_NOTES.md` at repo root.

### PLAN MODE (Non-blocking)

Deterministic plan and atomic tasks:

- YOU CANNOT DO ANY FILE MODIFICATIONS OR CHANGES.
- Prefer **agentic tools** for repo reconnaissance (symbol graphs, references, cross-repo search). Fall back to **system tools** when faster for raw code search or inventory
- Minimize questions; add labeled assumptions with explicit risks unless critical blockers
- Define acceptance criteria, test strategy (unit/integration/snapshots), and rollback
- Call out if breaking changes / backward compatibility are required
- Draw minimal diagrams only when they disambiguate design; use the output style native to the chosen agentic tool
- Represent the plan in the PR description as a checklist with acceptance criteria

### BUILD MODE (Non-blocking)

Minimal, reversible diffs:

- Execute plan steps in order; update tests with code in the same change
- Prefer stable, community-reviewed libraries; follow upstream install docs; integrate latest stable, then lock with the ecosystem's lockfile
- Multi-file edits: use agentic batch edits; if unavailable use non-interactive pipelines (search → filter → edit → verify) with `rg/find/xargs/sed/awk` or PowerShell equivalents
- Keep edits scoped; avoid opportunistic refactors unless they remove risk or unlock the task

### TEST MODE (Non-blocking)

Coverage that matters:

- Unit tests for utilities; integration for workflows; snapshot/golden tests for binaries with tolerance windows
- Prefer real fixtures/assets; otherwise generate realistic fixtures
- Treat performance and memory ceilings as tests where feasible
- Ensure happy paths and representative edge cases are covered

### VERIFY MODE (Non-blocking)

Pre-merge gates:

- Build/lint/format pass; smoke tests green; CI green across supported OS/toolchains
- If containers are used: multi-stage builds, minimal runtime image, non-root where possible

### SELF-REFLECT MODE (Non-blocking)

Confirm objectives/acceptance criteria met, diffs are scoped and reversible, no dead code or stale comments. Summarize changes briefly and record follow-ups in the PR.

## Tooling Policy

### Agentic (primary in Plan/Build)

- Code assistant with project memory and batch edit support (e.g., Cody / Claude Code). Keep loops short; checkpoint often

### System (adjacent/fallback)

**Cross-platform search / index**

- `rg` (ripgrep): fast, gitignore-aware search
- `fd`: friendly `find`
- `ctags` (Universal Ctags): tag index for editors/CLI jumps
- `fzf`: interactive filtering

**POSIX/GNU processing**

- `find`, `xargs`, `parallel` (GNU Parallel)
- `sed`, `awk` (gawk), `cut`, `tr`, `sort -u`, `uniq`, `comm`, `paste`
- `grep -RIn` as a fallback when `rg` is unavailable
- `jq` / `yq` for JSON/YAML
- `entr` for "on change, run ..."
- `diff -u`, `patch` for generating/applying surgical changes

**Windows equivalents**

- PowerShell: `Get-ChildItem`, `Select-String`, `ForEach-Object`, `Measure-Object`, `Set-Content`
- Package managers: `winget`, `choco`
- UNIX toolchains via MSYS2 or WSL when needed

**Native build acceleration**

- `ccache` / `sccache`, and `ninja` where applicable

**Reference one-liners**

```bash
# enumerate TODOs and risky markers
rg -n --no-messages 'TODO|FIXME|HACK|XXX'

# quick API inventory (tune per language)
rg -n --stats -S 'class |struct |interface |trait |def |fn ' -g '!**/vendor/**'

# safe batch edit skeleton
rg -l 'old_api' | xargs -r sed -i 's/old_api/new_api/g'
```

---

## Build & Containers

Expose canonical dev/build/test commands in `README`. Use multi-stage Dockerfiles; copy only required artifacts into the final image; run as non-root when possible.

---

## Coding Standards

**Primary language**

- Enforce the ecosystem's formatter/linter; keep checks fast
- Public APIs typed or interface-annotated, clear, simple, modular, stable
- Prefer simple, composable, "boring" patterns; add abstraction only when it reduces net complexity

**Design Patterns**

- Use a KISS/YAGNI/goldilocks approach
- Keep a balanced use of the remaining Software Engineering Patterns, but reevaluate the previous directives to weight them
- Lean on clean, modular, organic, easy to use contracts
- Promote Composition versus Inheritance (goldilocks)

**MCPs usage**

- Try to find and use all MCP available tools
- If the context7 MCP is available, always use context7 when I need code generation, setup or configuration steps, or library/API documentation
- If serena is available, read its instructions, and try to activate the project and use its tools

**Mentality**

- Simple, no complexity, no overengineering, don't try to be too smart
- Balance of simple, organic, easy, boring test patterns, composable code
- Avoid over-engineering, complexity
- Favor maintainability, low cognitive complexity
- Intuitive Naming: Functions read like natural language
- Discoverable API: Names suggest their purpose without documentation

**Shell**

- `set -euo pipefail`; use functions; keep logic minimal

**Make**

- Idempotent targets; explicit inputs/outputs; minimal `.PHONY`
- Provide `all`, `build`, `test`, `lint`, `fmt`, `clean`, `package`, `verify`

**Pipelines**

- Idempotent steps; pre/post validation; deterministic ordering; cross-platform; resumable via lightweight state files when helpful

**Prose**

- Professional, concise, human. No emojis or decorative styling

**Durable Runtime Lessons**

- Make ownership explicit: for each resource, define whether updates/locking are owned by the plugin or by the package manager
- Keep startup deterministic: persist a startup contract when runtime state may load too late
- Define fallback precedence once and keep it stable (local source -> managed install -> remote source)
- Treat cache as disposable by default; if cache becomes primary, define freshness and retention policy explicitly
- Do not bypass user mode/config policy via hidden force paths except for explicit, documented escape hatches
- Keep user-visible state labels aligned with lifecycle semantics (available/downloaded/installed/current)
- Make migrations idempotent and safe to re-run; no-op if already migrated

---

## Dependencies and Locking

Adopt → lock → verify. Use the platform's lockfile and reproducible installs (example for Python with `uv` shown elsewhere). Prefer maintained, popular libs; document upgrade/removal paths. Validate you're on a stable release unless pinned for a reason.

---

## Testing & CI

- Unit + integration on every feature; add property-based tests where it pays off
- CI matrix across relevant OS/toolchains; cache dependencies and compile artifacts; publish build artifacts for review
- Fail fast, surface logs clearly; keep pipelines under practical time budgets

---

## Change Management

- Small, single-concern commits and PRs
- Conventional Commits; link tasks in the PR checklist
- Include repro steps, risks, evidence (test output, logs, screenshots where relevant)

---

## Security

- No network writes without explicit approval
- Validate/sanitize external inputs; avoid unsafe deserialization; guard file paths
- Secret scanning in CI; minimal runtime images; prefer non-root execution
- Periodically audit dependencies; prefer latest stable when safe
